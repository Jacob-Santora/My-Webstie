                    <p>I had Jacob complete my PC build, and his work was outstanding and professional. During the build session he was very specific on safety, 
                        part conservation, cable management, and so much more. He built my PC not only an efficient and gentle way, but in a way in which I 
                        could understand his work, and even learn more about PC construction. Incredible work, 
                        would recommend to anyone who needs not only a very capable builder, but a genuinely nice individual.</p>
